# TOMO2D_2_TOY2DAC
A collection of Python algoritms to format seismic data for traveltime tomography in TOMO2D and full-waveform inversion in TOY2DAC.
These codes are written to complete a MSc. thesis titiled "Wide-Angle, Full Waveform Inversion with a Sparse Ocean-Bottom Seismometer Dataset, Imaging the Cyprus Arc from the Eratosthenes Seamount to the Hecataeus Rise".
The current version of TOMO2D_2_TOY2DAC contains the unedited codes used in this project. 
Current efforts are focused on improving these codes, and formatting them in a progarm.
